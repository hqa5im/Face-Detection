# Face-Detection
This is a face detection program which is built using a deep learning model and use of neutral networks (CNN). 

Remaining files for this program include:
- data (inital collection of data to be used)
  - labels
  - pictures
  - test
  - train
  - val
- augmented_data (augmented collection of data to be used)
  - labels
  - pictures
  - test
  - train
  - val

** I am still continually trying to improve the accuracy of the current program.
